## Requirements

-   Have [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) installed as a Node.js version manager
-   Have the `.env.development` file, it is in 1Password as a secure note called `[ .env.development ] POAP Kiosk - poap-xyz/poap-qr-kiosk`
-   (optional) Make sure you have access to the Firebase project `qr-kiosk-development` if you will run the functions backend offline. Note: you **never** need production credentials, the continuous integration has access to it
-   (optional) Use [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) or [VSCodium](https://vscodium.com/) for automatic style formatting

## Frontend usage

1. Clone this repo
1. `nvm use`
1. `npm i`
1. Populate `.env.development`
1. CHOICE MOMENT. Either:
    1. Run the firebase functions backend locally, see next section
    1. Comment out the `VITE_useEmulator` line in `.env.development` (this will make the frontend use the live backend)
1. `npm start`
   1 `npm run cypress` to run tests locally, if they all pass then your setup was successful

## Backend usage

1. `cd functions`
2. `nvm use`
3. `npm i`
4. Populate `functions/.env.development` with the 1Password note `[ function/.env.development ] POAP Kiosk functions`
5. `npm run serve`

## Maintenance

Most of the internal and external packages we use are semver compliant. Which is `major.patch.minor`, which you can read as `danger.attention.safe`. So `v1.2.5` -> `v1.9.535` is sage, but `v1.2.5` -> `v2.0.0` is dangerous.

Minor versions are upgraded in bulk, blindly, and tested automatedly. Major versions require you to read the release notes of the dependency to check if the announced breaking changes affect us. Only after that do we upgrade and test them. Usually you can find version updates by going to the package github or searching for `packge_name changelog`, sometimes you need to find the `CHANGELOG.md` in a repo. Pay special attention to major version bumps (scroll to the part where the major version changes, don't just read the latest release notes).

**Dependency bumps (frontend)**

-   Minor updates are done by running `npm run upgrade`
-   Major updates are done by running `ncu --doctor -u PACKAGE1,PACKAGE2,...`, this will incrementally install a package and then run tests to check if everything works
    -   double check that the emulator suite is running if your `.env.development` includes `VITE_useEmulator=true`

**Dependency bumps (backend)**

-   Updates are done assisted by `ncu`, and tested locally after bumps, then tested in CI through pull requests

## Tech stack

App code based on `vite`, styling based on `styled-components`, routing using `react-router`.

Backend runs on a Firebase project.

ðŸŽ¨ Styling loosely uses [atomic design](https://atomicdesign.bradfrost.com/chapter-2/) implemented with the [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) library. The essence of this approach is that visual components are split into categories:

-   Atoms are design elements that are singular but styled: e.g. a button.
-   Molecules are atom combinations that commonly occur together: e.g. a label + input + button.
-   Organisms are atoms/molecules that make a functional component together: e.g. an app header with a menu, search bar and logo.
-   Pages are combinations of the above that we show to users, in the context of this app they are components used in a `Route`.

## Developer flow

This app follows the [POAP git flow](https://app.gitbook.com/o/-Mdt3oJeD814je5SQu8h/s/-Mdt48AX0KOLHPttMYWw/development/onboarding/git) and follows the _psychopath coder principle_:

> "Always code as if the guy who ends up maintaining your code will be a violent psychopath who knows where you live" ~ John Woods

To prevent the psycho from pursuing you:

1. Write for clarity and comprehension, self documenting code does not exist
2. Leave a "what this does" comment for **every** function, preferably in JSDoc
3. Be as descriptive as possible in commits and PRs
4. Assume the next person working on your code is much more junior than you

## Setting up new Firebase projects

To configure Firebase services:

1. Enable firestore, functions, hosting, analytics
2. Enable [app check](https://console.firebase.google.com/u/0/project/poap-qr-kiosk/settings/appcheck) ([docs](https://firebase.google.com/docs/app-check/web/recaptcha-provider))
3. Fill out all variables in `.env` from 1Password
